### When we use "dog" in a sentence...

.pull-left[

dog food：sth you mess up

```{r, out.width = '90%',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/food.jpg")
```

]

.pull-right[

also in Chinese...

<br>

```{r, out.width = '90%',echo=FALSE}

## Why dogs?

- Sturdy body

- Strong sense of feeling

- smart brain

- high obedience

### In the past, we thought dogs can only understand simple "verbs", and study showed the same result by involved them fetching specific objects when asked...


```{r, out.width = '90%',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/舊實驗.jpg")
```

## THE NEW EXPERIMENT

```{r, out.width = '110%',echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/流程.jpg")
```


---

###  RESULT1：Familiar and unfamiliar objects

If the noun is familiar to the dog, there will be a greater response in the dog's brain.

```{r, out.width = '100%',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/熟悉.jpg")
```

---

###  RESULT2：Matching words with objects

when a dog understands a word, it means in the absence of the object, the dog activates a so-called mental representation, thus...

```{r, out.width = '100%',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/符合.jpg")
```


---

## Holding a hesitant attitude...

- the experiment was a “clever” concept but it showed dogs understood a “stimulus” followed by an “important consequence” rather than the meaning intrinsic to a word.

- dogs lacked the two areas of the brain crucial for human understanding of language therefore the EEG pattern highlighted by the researchers was not shared by humans.

- If we’re making a claim that the pattern of the brainwave shows you that it must be an understanding of words, you need it to be the same pattern

### Rapidly advancing neuroscience...

### can lead to exciting prospects for understanding our own brains

### but also...

### infringe upon our privacy and  rights
